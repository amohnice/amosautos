### Auto-Parts Website documentation: **designed with a clean and modern aesthetic in mind.**

- The layout focuses on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring a smooth user experience across various devices.
- The color scheme was kept minimal, with a light theme by default and a dark mode toggle for users to switch to a darker interface.
- This design decision was made to enhance accessibility and provide users with more control over their browsing experience.
- The layout is responsive, allowing for a consistent look on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features Implemented Using JavaScript:

1. **Smooth Scrolling**: JavaScript is used to smoothly scroll to different sections of the page when clicking on anchor links. This was achieved by selecting all anchor tags that link to sections within the same page and applying the scrollIntoView method for a smooth transition.
2. **Dark Mode Toggle**: A toggle button allows users to switch between light and dark modes. By using JavaScript, the bodyâ€™s class is toggled between dark-mode and the default class, while updating the button icon to reflect the selected theme (sun or moon).
3. **Image Carousel**: The carousel functionality is controlled via JavaScript, where users can click on navigation buttons to move between slides or let the carousel automatically transition every 3 seconds. The carousel uses translateX to move items smoothly.
4. **Form Validation**: The contact form and newsletter subscription include basic error handling with JavaScript. If the user fails to fill out the required fields, an alert is triggered asking them to fill in the missing information.
5. **Navbar Toggling**: The JavaScript code toggles the mobile navigation menu when the hamburger icon (nav-toggler) is clicked. It also handles showing and hiding the overlay that covers the screen when the menu is open.
6. **Back-to-Top Button**: When users scroll down, a back-to-top button becomes visible. When clicked, it smoothly scrolls the user to the top of the page. The button's visibility is controlled by the scroll position.

## Challenges and Solutions:

- One of the challenges faced during development was implementing the smooth scrolling feature across various browsers and ensuring that the page elements aligned properly when the user navigated between sections. I overcame this by using the scrollIntoView method and testing on multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

- Additionally, integrating the carousel with both automatic and manual navigation was a challenge. To resolve this, I used JavaScript to manage the state of the carousel items and ensure both functionalities worked seamlessly, with setInterval controlling automatic transitions.

## Deployment Process:
- The website was deployed using Netlify. The process involved uploading files to the netlify without connecting to Git. After that, I changed the default given url to something relevant [https://amosautos.netlify.app/]. This allowed me to deploy the website quickly and efficiently with no server configuration required. The setback of this method of uploading folder to netlify is that there is no automatic updates unlike connecting to git repository.
